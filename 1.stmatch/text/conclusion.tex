\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we study the parallelization of backtracking-based graph pattern matching on GPU. 
We propose a stack-based implementation that avoids the synchronization and memory consumption issues of previous systems. 
We also show that the performance of our system can be improved by applying a series of loop optimizations. 
The experiments show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.
